# Simple high precision patterns for kbp relations.
# Patterns wildcard target and slotfiller as $ARG1 and $ARG2.
# For reflexive relations, both arguments are wildcarded as $ARG0.
# There is also a wildcard '*' standing for 1-4 arbitrary tokens. 
# The patterns are meant to be sent to a search engine, and the results
# to be filtered by a suitable type checker. In the combination with a type
# checker, the patterns should unambiguously express the relation.
# Basis for the patterns were:
#  - The definition of the slots using the TAC KBP guidelines of 2011,
#  - The examples given in the guidelines, and
#  - introspection/linguistic intuition generalizing from both.
# No actual queries/slot fillers/assessments of the task were looked at.
# It cannot be assumed that matching is done case invariant. However, patterns
# should not be combinatorially blown up to incorporate different casing 
# variants, and always the correct/most common casing should be used only.

# TODO: tokenization: "," vs " ," "'s" vs " 's", "'" vs " '", "(" vs "( "
# Is this reflexive?
